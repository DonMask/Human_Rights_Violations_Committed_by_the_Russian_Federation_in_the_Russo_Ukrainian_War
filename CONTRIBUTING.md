## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions that align with the project's goals and maintain its commitment to verified data, ethical analysis, and respect for the subject matter. Below are suggested areas for contribution:

### 1. Sourcing Verified Data
- Add or update references in `docs/references.bib` with credible sources (e.g., UN, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch).
- Propose new data for graphs in `docs/graphs.tex` (e.g., updated civilian casualty figures, refugee statistics).
- Ensure all sources are publicly accessible and meet academic standards.

### 2. Translating the Report
- Translate the full report (`output.pdf`) or executive summary (`summary.pdf`) into other languages to broaden its reach.
- Submit translations as new files (e.g., `summary_fr.pdf` for French) or propose integration into the LaTeX source.

### 3. Improving LaTeX Code
- Enhance `main.tex`, `summary.tex`, `docs/graphs.tex`, or `docs/logo.tex` for better formatting, accessibility, or visual appeal.
- Optimize the bibliography in `docs/references.bib` for consistency (IEEE style).
- Suggest new features, such as additional graphs or sections.

### 4. Automating the Repository
- Improve the `MAKEFILE` for local compilation efficiency.
- Propose GitHub Actions for automated PDF generation or testing.
- Suggest scripts to streamline updates or distribution.

### 5. Amplifying Distribution
- Share the report (`output.pdf`) or summary (`summary.pdf`) with media, NGOs, or academic institutions.
- Propose new distribution channels (e.g., social media campaigns, conferences).
- Suggest additional hashtags beyond `#UkraineJustice`, `#HumanRights`, `#RussoUkrainianWar`.

### 6. Providing Feedback
- Report errors, typos, or inconsistencies in the report or code.
- Suggest improvements to the structure, clarity, or impact of the content.
